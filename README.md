# BOOKEX

## Description
This is a web application for a service of selling, interchanging or gifting books between the users of the app.
This app uses:
* React.
* Meteor.
* Node.
* MongoDB.

## Motivation
This is a project for a web development class in [Uniandes](https://www.uniandes.edu.co). The objective is to make a quick project using node, MongoDB, Meteor and ReactJS.

## Getting Started
if you want to run this project locally you are going to need ```npm``` and ```Meteor```. If you want to see a live demo of the project already deployed go [here.](https://book-ex.herokuapp.com/)

## Deployment
If you are going to deploy locally and not check the [demo](https://book-ex.herokuapp.com/) then the first step is to download this repository on your system. Once you are done with that then:

### NPM
The next step is to install all the npm packages for the projects. If you have ```Meteor``` installed then open your terminal, get inside the repo where you have the repo downloaded and run:
* ```meteor npm install```
* or: ```npm install```

### Meteor
After all the npm packages are downloaded you are going to need to run it. For that you will need `Meteor` again, you don't need to enter any folder, just run `meteor` on the terminal and wait until it says `started your app` on the terminal.

### Seeing it Live
Now you only need to open your browser and write ```localhost:3000``` on the address bar and send it to see the live version of the project running locally.
